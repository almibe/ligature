# Ligature

Ligature is an free and open source Knowledge Base.
Ligature allows you to model your data in a flexible way based on statements made about nodes.
Ligature takes a lot of inspiration from RDF but attempts to be more general purpose and applicable outside of the semantic web.
This project provides the API all implementations of Ligature should implement.

## Implementations

 * ligature-in-memory - an example implementation of Ligature based on in-memory graphs (specifically Google Guava's Networks).
 * ligature-xodus - an embeddable version of this API that works in-memory or persisted to disk (based on JetBrains' Xodus database).
 * ligature-foundationdb - a distributed version of Ligature (based on Apple's FoundationDB).

## How Does Ligature Model Data?

Below is a chart showing what types are expected for each part of a statement in Ligature.

| Entity | Attribute | Value   | Context? |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| Node   | Attribute | Node    | Node     |
|        |           | Literal |          |

Ligature strives to contain the bare number of concepts needed to represent data via statements.
A Node is simply something that can be referred to.
A Node can be referenced by its Id (which is autogenerated by the database).
Attributes contain a user defined label.
Literals are values of a certain type.
 * LangLiteral(val value: String, val langTag: String): Literal()
 * StringLiteral(val value: String): Literal()
 * BooleanLiteral(val value: Boolean): Literal()
 * IntLiteral(val value: Int): Literal()
 * LongLiteral(val value: Long): Literal()
 * DecimalLiteral(val value: BigDecimal): Literal()
 * TimeLiteral(val value: LocalTime): Literal()
 * DateLiteral(val value: LocalDate): Literal()
Context is the only optional part of a Statement that allows you to make statements about statements.
