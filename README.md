# Ligature

Ligature is a library that supports parsing N-Triples and Turtle and loading them into an
OrientDB graph database instance for processing with JVM applications.

The goals of this project are as follows:
* Support the N-Triples (http://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/) and 
Turtle (https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) specifications with ANTRL grammars
* Load data sources into an OrientDB database instance
* Have extensive example based tests written in Spock (http://spockframework.org/)
* Support OSGi
